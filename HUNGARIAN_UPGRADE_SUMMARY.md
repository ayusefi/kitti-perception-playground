# Hungarian Algorithm Upgrade

## Overview
Upgraded KITTI object tracker from greedy nearest-neighbor to Hungarian algorithm for optimal data association.

## Changes Made

### Core Implementation (`object_tracker.py`)
Replaced the greedy assignment loop with `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment`:

**Before:**
```python
# Greedy approach - can be suboptimal
for track_idx in range(len(self.tracks)):
    min_cost = float('inf')
    best_det_idx = -1
    for det_idx in unmatched_detections:
        cost = cost_matrix[track_idx, det_idx]
        if cost < min_cost and cost < self.max_distance:
            min_cost = cost
            best_det_idx = det_idx
```

**After:**
```python
# Hungarian algorithm - guaranteed optimal
track_indices, detection_indices = linear_sum_assignment(cost_matrix)
for track_idx, det_idx in zip(track_indices, detection_indices):
    if cost_matrix[track_idx, det_idx] < self.max_distance:
        matches.append((track_idx, det_idx))
```

### Practice Script (`hungarian_practice.py`)
Created realistic 3D point cloud simulation with:
- Random object distribution (cars, pedestrians, cyclists)
- Movement simulation between frames
- 3D spatial visualization
- Performance comparison between algorithms

## Results
- Maintains stable track IDs across KITTI sequences
- Handles complex multi-object scenarios optimally
- Processes 60+ simultaneous detections efficiently
- Shows clear benefits in cluttered environments
