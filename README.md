## 🚀 Scripts and Usage

### 1. load_data.py - Data Loading and 3D Visualization

#### Description
The foundational script that demonstrates how to load and visualize KITTI dataset components. This script parses calibration files, loads LiDAR point clouds from binary files, and creates interactive 3D visualizations using Open3D.

#### What it does:
- Parses KITTI calibration files (calib_cam_to_cam.txt, calib_velo_to_cam.txt)
- Loads LiDAR point cloud data from .bin files
- Creates interactive 3D point cloud visualization
- Displays point cloud with coordinate axes and proper scaling

#### Dependencies:
- `numpy` - For numerical array operations
- `open3d` - For 3D visualization and point cloud processing
- `os` - For file path operations
- `glob` - For file pattern matching

#### How to run:
```bash
python load_data.py
```

#### Expected Output:
- Interactive 3D viewer window opens with the point cloud
- Console output showing number of points loaded
- Ability to rotate, zoom, and pan the 3D view

### 2. project_lidar_to_camera.py - LiDAR-to-Camera Projection

#### Description
The core sensor fusion script that demonstrates how to project 3D LiDAR points onto 2D camera images. This is a fundamental task in autonomous vehicle perception, enabling the combination of depth information from LiDAR with visual information from cameras.

#### What it does:
- Loads synchronized camera images and LiDAR point clouds
- Applies coordinate system transformations (Velodyne → Camera → Image)
- Projects 3D points to 2D image coordinates using calibration matrices
- Filters points that fall within image boundaries
- Color-codes projected points by depth (red = close, blue = far)
- Saves the final projection result as an image

#### Dependencies:
- `numpy` - For matrix operations and numerical computing
- `opencv-python` - For image processing and display
- `matplotlib` - For color mapping and visualization
- `glob` - For file management
- `typing` - For type hints

#### How to run:
```bash
python project_lidar_to_camera.py
```

#### Configuration:
Update the `data_path` variable in the `main()` function to point to your KITTI dataset location.

#### Expected Output:
- Console output with projection statistics
- Saved image in `output/` directory
- Optional display window showing the projection result

**Sample Output:**

*LiDAR points projected onto camera image with depth-based color coding. Red points are closer objects, blue points are farther away*

#### Sample Statistics:
```
Projection Statistics:
  Total LiDAR points: 124,668
  Points in image: 8,247
  Depth range: 2.15 - 49.83 meters
  Average depth: 12.34 meters
```

### 3. segment_ground.py - Ground Plane Segmentation

#### Description
An advanced perception script that implements RANSAC-based ground plane detection and segmentation. This technique is crucial for autonomous vehicles to distinguish between the road surface and obstacles/objects that need to be avoided.

#### What it does:
- Loads LiDAR point cloud data
- Applies RANSAC algorithm to detect the dominant ground plane
- Segments points into ground vs. non-ground categories
- Creates visualization with different colors for ground (gray) and objects (red)
- Saves segmentation results and statistics

#### Dependencies:
- `numpy` - For numerical operations
- `open3d` - For 3D processing and RANSAC implementation
- `matplotlib` - For visualization and color mapping
- `os` - For file operations

#### How to run:
```bash
python segment_ground.py
```

#### Algorithm Parameters:
- **Distance threshold**: 0.2 meters (points within this distance are considered part of the plane)
- **RANSAC iterations**: 1000 (maximum number of iterations for plane fitting)
- **Minimum plane points**: 1000 (minimum number of points required for a valid plane)

#### Expected Output:
- Console output with segmentation statistics
- Interactive 3D visualization showing ground vs. objects
- Saved segmentation result images from multiple views

*Multiple views of ground plane segmentation: analysis, front, side, and top perspectives help visualize how the algorithm distinguishes ground points (gray) from obstacles (red).*

### 4. cluster\_objects.py – Object Clustering & Filtering

**Description:**
A complete clustering pipeline wrapped in a `PerceptionPipeline` class:

1. Load & remove ground points using RANSAC
2. Cluster non‑ground points via DBSCAN
3. Filter clusters by bounding‑box volume and point count
4. Save a top‑view PNG snapshot
5. Launch an interactive Open3D 3D viewer

**Dependencies:**

* `numpy`
* `open3d`
* `os`

**How to run:**

```bash
python cluster_objects.py
```

**Configuration:**
Override defaults by passing a `config` dict into `PerceptionPipeline`:

```python
custom_config = {
  'filter': {'min_volume': 2.0, 'min_points': 30},
  'dbscan': {'eps': 0.5, 'min_points': 15}
}
pipeline = PerceptionPipeline(data_path, custom_config)
```

**Expected Output:**

* Console logs of each processing step
* Top‑view image saved to `output/perception_pipeline_frame_000010.png`
* Interactive 3D window with colored clusters and bounding boxes
